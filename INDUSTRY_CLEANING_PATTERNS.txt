Implementation Plan for DataCleanr
==================================

1. Domain Detection Algorithm:
   - Analyze column names for industry-specific keywords
   - Examine data patterns and distributions
   - Identify data types and formats typical for each industry

2. Industry-Specific Cleaning Suggestions:
   - Based on detected domain, provide relevant cleaning options
   - Offer industry-standard algorithms for data processing
   - Provide domain-specific validation rules

3. Enhanced Auto-Detection Features:
   - Detect industry-specific data patterns
   - Suggest domain-appropriate cleaning steps
   - Recommend industry best practices

4. New API Endpoints:
   - /api/detect-domain - Identify likely industry domain
   - /api/industry-suggestions - Get industry-specific cleaning suggestions
   - Enhanced /api/suggest with domain awareness

This enhancement will make DataCleanr more intelligent by providing context-aware cleaning suggestions based on the type of data being processed, rather than generic cleaning operations.
