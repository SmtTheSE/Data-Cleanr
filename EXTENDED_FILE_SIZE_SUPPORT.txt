Extended File Size Support to 1GB
================================

Problem
-------
The previous file upload limit was 50MB, which is insufficient for large datasets that users may need to process.

Solution Implemented
--------------------
Extended the file upload limit from 50MB to 1GB (1024MB) to support larger datasets.

Changes Made
------------
1. Modified backend/main.py:
   - Increased file size limit check from 50MB to 1GB
   - Updated error message to reflect new 1GB limit

Technical Details
-----------------
File modified: backend/main.py
Function updated: upload_file

Changed line:
```python
# Check file size (limit to 1GB)
if len(content) > 1 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="File size exceeds 1GB limit. Please upload a smaller file.")
```

Benefits
--------
1. Users can now upload much larger files (up to 1GB)
2. Supports processing of extensive datasets
3. Maintains system stability with clear limits
4. Provides informative error messages when limits are exceeded

Considerations
--------------
1. Large file uploads may take longer depending on network speed
2. Processing very large datasets may require more memory
3. Users should be aware that uploads are still limited to 1GB for system stability
4. Very large files may take longer to process

Testing
-------
To test the new limit:
1. Try uploading a file between 50MB and 1GB - should work correctly
2. Try uploading a file larger than 1GB - should get a clear size limit error
3. Try uploading a valid file under 1GB - should work as expected

Performance Notes
-----------------
1. Files up to 1GB are now supported
2. Upload time will depend on network connection speed
3. Processing time will depend on file size and system resources
4. Memory usage will increase with larger files
