Fixed File Upload Issues in DataCleanr
=====================================

Problem Identified
------------------
1. File uploads were failing with a 400 Bad Request error
2. File size limits were too restrictive
3. Error messages were not informative enough
4. Limited encoding support for CSV files

Issues Fixed
------------
1. Increased file size limit from default to 50MB
2. Added explicit file size checking with clear error messages
3. Improved error handling with more descriptive messages
4. Added support for multiple CSV encodings (UTF-8 and Latin-1)
5. Added data validation to ensure uploaded files contain actual data
6. Updated server configuration to handle larger requests

Technical Details
-----------------
File modified: backend/main.py
Function updated: upload_file

Key improvements:
1. Added file size check with 50MB limit
2. Enhanced CSV reading to support multiple encodings
3. Improved error handling with specific messages for different failure cases
4. Added data validation to check for empty files
5. Better exception handling with proper HTTP status codes

File modified: backend/start.sh
Command updated: uvicorn command

Key improvements:
1. Added --limit-max-requests 0 parameter to remove request limits

Error Handling Improvements
---------------------------
1. File size exceeded: "File size exceeds 50MB limit. Please upload a smaller file."
2. Unsupported format: "Unsupported file format. Please upload a CSV or Excel file."
3. Encoding issues: "Unable to decode file. Please ensure it's a valid CSV file with UTF-8 or Latin-1 encoding."
4. Empty files: "Uploaded file is empty or contains no data."
5. Parsing errors: "Unable to parse file. Please ensure it's a valid CSV or Excel file. Error: {specific error}"
6. General errors: "Error processing file: {specific error}"

Testing
-------
To test the fixes:
1. Try uploading a file larger than 50MB - should get a clear size limit error
2. Try uploading a valid CSV/Excel file under 50MB - should work correctly
3. Try uploading a file with unsupported format - should get format error
4. Try uploading an empty file - should get empty file error

Benefits
--------
1. Users can now upload larger files (up to 50MB)
2. More informative error messages help users understand what went wrong
3. Better support for different file encodings
4. More robust error handling prevents server crashes
5. Clearer feedback helps users resolve issues on their own
