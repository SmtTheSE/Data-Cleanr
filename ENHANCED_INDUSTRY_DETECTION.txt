Enhanced Industry Detection in DataCleanr
========================================

Problem Identified
------------------
The initial industry detection algorithm only analyzed column names and did not consider the actual content of the data. This led to cases where datasets were classified as "General" even when they clearly belonged to a specific industry.

Improvements Made
-----------------
1. Enhanced keyword lists for each industry to include more specific terms
2. Added data content analysis to examine actual values in the dataset
3. Improved confidence calculation with more realistic maximum possible scores
4. Maintained the minimum confidence threshold to prevent weak matches

Enhanced Industry Keywords
--------------------------
Each industry now has a more comprehensive list of keywords that better represent that domain:

1. Retail/E-commerce:
   - Added: transaction, shipping, delivery, benefit, segment
   - Original: product, customer, order, sku, price, sales, purchase, cart, inventory

2. Finance/Banking:
   - Added: benefit
   - Original: account, transaction, balance, credit, debit, loan, interest, currency

3. Healthcare:
   - No changes: patient, doctor, diagnosis, treatment, medical, hospital, clinic, insurance, claim

4. Manufacturing:
   - No changes: production, machine, sensor, equipment, maintenance, quality, defect

5. Demand Planning:
   - No changes: demand, forecast, planning, inventory, supply, chain, stock, reorder

6. Education:
   - No changes: student, course, grade, score, exam, assignment, gpa, degree, major, faculty, department, enrollment, academic, semester, tuition

7. Law Enforcement:
   - No changes: crime, offense, incident, case, arrest, charge, violation, weapon, battery, assault, robbery, theft, trespass, domestic, location, date, primary_type, description, updated_on

Data Content Analysis
---------------------
The enhanced algorithm now examines actual data content in addition to column names:

1. For Retail/E-commerce:
   - Checks columns with "delivery" or "shipping" in the name for values containing these terms
   - Identifies customer-related data
   - Recognizes sales/benefit/price related data

2. For Finance/Banking:
   - Looks for finance-related values in appropriate columns

3. For Healthcare:
   - Identifies healthcare-related values in relevant columns

4. For Education:
   - Searches for education-specific values

5. For other industries:
   - Similar pattern-based content analysis

Confidence Calculation Improvements
-----------------------------------
1. Updated maximum possible scores to account for both column name matches and data content analysis
2. Maintained the minimum confidence threshold of 0.1 (10%) to prevent weak classifications
3. Improved the ratio calculation to be more accurate

Example Dataset Analysis
------------------------
Based on the dataset described with fields:
- Type (of transaction)
- Days for shipping (real)
- Days for shipment (scheduled)
- Benefit per order
- Sales per customer
- Delivery Status
- Late_delivery_risk
- Category Id/Name
- Customer information fields

The enhanced algorithm would now correctly identify this as Retail/E-commerce data because:
1. Column name matches: "shipping", "delivery", "benefit", "sales", "customer"
2. Data content analysis: Would find shipping/delivery related values in appropriate columns

Expected Results
----------------
With these improvements, datasets like the example provided will be correctly classified as "Retail/E-commerce" with an appropriate confidence level rather than being classified as "General".

The algorithm now considers both structural (column names) and semantic (data content) aspects of datasets, making it more accurate and robust in identifying the correct industry.
